## Original Data

```{r}
olympics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/olympics.csv')

world <- map_data("world")


```

## Filtered Data Sets

```{r}
summer_gold <- olympics %>% 
  filter(season == "Summer") %>% 
  drop_na(medal) %>% 
  filter(medal == "Gold") %>% 
   mutate(countryName = countrycode(noc, "genc3c", "country.name")) %>% 
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(countryName == "United States", "USA", countryName)) 
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "ALG", "Algeria", countryName)) %>% 
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "BAH", "Bahamas", countryName)) %>%

Instructions that might be useful to remember:

* **NEW!!** With animated graphs, add `eval=FALSE` to the code chunk that creates the animation and saves it using `anim_save()`. Add another code chunk to reread the gif back into the file. See the [tutorial](https://animation-and-interactivity-in-r.netlify.app/) for help. 

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


##Taking data out "on a walk" (aka brainstorming)

```{r}

summer_gold2 <- summer_gold %>%
  group_by(countryName) %>% 
  count(medal) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) #results in a medal count in descending order
```



##Mapping the Medals
How have medals accumulated in each country over time?

In this animation, you can see the medals accumulate since the beginning of the Olympics, which began in 1896 in Athens. It shows that the first countries to receive medals were mainly western countries, and the countries that accumulated the most medals were also western countries, particularly the US. It is interesting to see that countries would pop up throughout time, meaning that it was the first time they won a gold medal in the Olympics, but also signifying that it was one of the first times that athletes from this country were involved in the Olympics. Perhaps, wen we evaluate the athletic capabilities of each country, we should take into account the resources that certain countries posses that allow them to send multitudenous athletes to the Olympics.

```{r}
olympics2 <- olympics %>% 
  select(noc, medal, year) %>% 
  drop_na(medal) %>% 
  filter(medal == "Gold") %>% 
  group_by(noc, year) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(cum_medals = cumsum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(countryName = countrycode(noc, "genc3c", "country.name")) %>% 
  mutate(countryName = ifelse(countryName == "United States", "USA", countryName)) %>% 
  mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "ALG", "Algeria", countryName)) %>% 
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "BAH", "Bahamas", countryName)) %>%
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "BUL", "Bulgaria", countryName)) %>%
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "CHI", "Chile", countryName)) %>%
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "CRC", "Costa Rica", countryName)) %>%
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "CRO", "Croatia", countryName)) %>%
   mutate(countryName = ifelse(noc == "DEN", "Denmark", countryName)) %>%

##Mapping the Olympics
Where have the Olympics been located?

From the circles, we can see that most of the Olympics have been located in Europe and the United States. There is only only Olympic Games that has happened in South America, which was specifically in Rio de Janeiro. Throughout these Olympics, various issues occurred, including the destruction of houses located in favelas. Though it is important to have the Olympics in various locations around the world, as  it is an international event, it is also crucial to understand the implications and consequences of hosting the Olympics.

```{r}
olympic_coordinates <- tibble(
  place = c("Paris","London","Beijing","Stockholm","Melbourne","Sydney","Atlanta","Moskva","Seoul","Los Angeles","Roma","Munich","Barcelona","St. Louis","Athina","Rio de Janeiro","Antwerpen","Montreal","Berlin","Helsinki","Tokyo","Amsterdam","Mexico City"),
  long = c(2.3483915, 0.1276, 116.4074,18.0686, 144.9631, 151.2093,-84.3880, 37.6173, 126.9780, -118.2437, 12.4964, 11.5820, 2.1686, -90.1994, 23.7275, -43.1729, 4.4051, -73.5673, 13.4050, 24.9384, 139.6503, 4.9041, -99.1332),
  lat = c(48.8534951, 51.5072, 39.9042, 59.3293, -37.8136, -33.8688, 33.7490, 55.7558, 37.5665, 34.0522, 41.9028, 48.1351, 41.3874, 38.6270, 37.9838, -22.9068, 51.2213, 45.5017, 52.5200, 60.1699, 35.6762, 52.3676, 19.4326))

location_olympics <- summer_gold %>%
  select(year, city) %>%
  distinct(city) %>% pull(city)

leaflet(data = olympic_coordinates) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircles(lng = ~long,
             lat = ~lat,
             label = ~place,
             weight = 6)
  
```
